    jobTitle: "Software Engineer, Developer Experience",
    jobDescription: `At Groq. We believe in an AI economy powered by human agency. We envision a world where AI is accessible to all, a world that demands processing power that is better, faster, and more affordable than is available today. AI applications are currently constrained by the limitations of the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), a technology originally developed for the gaming market and soon to become the weakest link in the AI economy.

Enter Groq's LPU™ Inference Engine. Specifically engineered for the demands of large language models (LLMs), the Language Processing Unit outpaces the GPU in speed, power, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. The quickest way to understand the opportunity is to watch the following talk – groq.link/scspdemo.

Why join Groq? AI will change humanity forever, and we believe preservation of human agency and self determination is only possible if AI is made affordably and universally accessible. Groq’s LPUs will power AI from an early stage, and you will get to leave your fingerprint on civilization.
