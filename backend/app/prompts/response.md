Here are example responses for each question, with one example at a 5 level and one at a 1 level:

**Question 1: Can you describe a project you worked on where you had to optimize the performance of a complex system? What steps did you take to identify bottlenecks, and how did you measure the impact of your changes?**

5-level response:
"In my previous role as a software engineer at a fintech startup, I worked on optimizing the performance of our real-time transaction processing system. We were experiencing high latency and frequent timeouts, which were affecting our user experience and revenue. I used a combination of profiling tools and system logs to identify the bottlenecks, which turned out to be inefficient database queries and inadequate caching. I refactorized the queries to reduce the number of round trips to the database and implemented a caching layer using Redis. I measured the impact of my changes using metrics such as request latency, error rates, and CPU utilization. After the optimization, we saw a 75% reduction in latency and a 90% reduction in error rates, which led to a significant improvement in user experience and revenue."

1-level response:
"Uh, yeah, I worked on a project where we had to make it faster... I think it was a web app or something. We just added some caching and stuff, and it got faster. I'm not really sure how we measured it, but it seemed to work better after that."

**Question 2: Tell me about a time when you had to work on a team to develop a new feature or API. What was your role in the project, and how did you contribute to its success?**

5-level response:
"In my current role as a software engineer at a cloud computing company, I worked on a team to develop a new API for automating infrastructure provisioning. My role was to design and implement the API's authentication and authorization layer. I contributed to the project's success by working closely with the product manager to understand the requirements, collaborating with the UX designer to ensure a seamless user experience, and implementing a robust and secure authentication mechanism using OAuth. I also helped to review and test my colleagues' code, ensuring that the entire API was thoroughly tested and bug-free. The API was released on time and received positive feedback from our customers, who appreciated the increased security and ease of use."

1-level response:
"I worked on a team once... I think we were building a new feature for a website or something. I don't really remember what my role was, but I just did some coding stuff and it worked, I guess. I don't really know what the others did, but we all just sort of worked together, I think."

**Question 3: How do you approach debugging complex issues in your code? Can you walk me through your thought process and the steps you take to identify and fix the issue?**

5-level response:
"When debugging complex issues, I follow a structured approach to identify and fix the problem. First, I reproduce the issue to understand the symptoms and gather more information. Next, I use logging and debugging tools to identify the source of the issue. Then, I use a process of elimination to narrow down the possible causes, and finally, I use my knowledge of the code and the system to identify the root cause. Once I have identified the cause, I develop a plan to fix the issue, which may involve refactoring code, updating dependencies, or modifying system configurations. I also make sure to test the fix thoroughly to ensure that it resolves the issue and doesn't introduce new problems. For example, in my previous role, I spent several hours debugging a complex issue with our distributed caching system. I used logging and debugging tools to identify the issue, isolated the problem to a specific node in the cluster, and developed a plan to fix the issue by updating the node's configuration and implementing a rolling restart. The fix was successful, and the system returned to normal operation."

1-level response:
"Uh, debugging is hard... I just try stuff until it works, I guess. I mean, I look at the code and try to figure out what's wrong, but it's usually just a typo or something. Sometimes I Google it and find an answer on Stack Overflow. I don't really have a process or anything, I just kind of wing it and hope it works."

**Question 4: Can you describe a project or feature you worked on that required you to balance competing priorities, such as performance, security, and user experience? How did you approach this project, and what was the outcome?**

5-level response:
"In my previous role as a software engineer at a mobile app development company, I worked on a project to develop a new in-app payment feature. The project required balancing competing priorities such as performance, security, and user experience. I approached this project by working closely with the product manager to understand the requirements and trade-offs, and by developing a clear set of goals and priorities. I implemented a secure payment gateway using industry-standard encryption and tokenization,
