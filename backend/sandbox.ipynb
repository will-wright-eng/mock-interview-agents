      "User: Uh, sure. My name is Jonathan, and I've been a software engineer for 7 years. Uh, during that time, I've worked at large companies and, like, FAANG companies as well as smaller startups. Uh, mostly done back end, but recently have done more full stack, and I also have some experience with distributed systems.\n",
      "AI: That's impressive, Jonathan. It sounds like you have a diverse range of experience in the industry. Given your background, I'm curious to know more about a project where you had to optimize the performance of a system or application. Can you describe your approach and the outcome of that project?\n",

      "AI: Can you describe a time when you had to optimize the performance of a system or application? What was your approach and what was the outcome?\n",
      "User: Sure. Uh, so in my previous role at a high frequency trading firm, I was responsible for optimizing our real time market data processing pipeline, Uh, this system was struggling to keep up with inter increasing volumes of data, and this led to delays in trade execution So my strategy was to, um, first do profiling using tools like pprof or Golang or Visual FVM for the Java. Um, and this shows that JSON parsing and database rights were the main performance issues Um, I also replaced JSON with protocol buffers. For the data serialization and deserialization. Um, there were a few other improvements that we made, but I'll I'll sort of just skip to the main outcome, which was that we saw pros processing latency decrease hundred uh, milliseconds to 5 milliseconds, and system throughput increased by 400 percent handling a million messages second. And so um, this solved our performance issues. And throughout that time, I collaborated closely with our infrastructure team, um, to make sure that things were deployed safely, uh, and scalably.\n",
      "AI: That's a fantastic example, Jonathan. It's clear that you took a comprehensive approach to identifying and addressing the performance bottlenecks in the system. Collaborating closely with the infrastructure team, also shows your ability to work effectively with others to achieve a significant outcome. I'm impressed by the measurable improvements you were able to achieve. You for sharing that. Now let's move on to another question.

Uh, I don't really worry too much about Um, how those existing APIs are designed or documented, because I don't really want to have to take on some refactoring work, um, or introduce new bugs. Um, I think simplicity means having fewer endpoints So I try to make each endpoint do multiple things, and that, uh, that ends up making things Simpler. Over the long run.\n",
